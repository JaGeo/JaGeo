### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:woman_scientist: I am a postdoctoral researcher at [UnversitÃ© catholique de Louvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/index.html) and I develope code to do materials science.

:atom_symbol: I am searching for new materials with desired properties and I aim at understanding materials properties with the help of [bonding analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jcc.26353) ([:lobster:](http://www.cohp.de/)) and [coordination environments](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/ChemEnv_A_Fast_and_Robust_Coordination_Environment_Identification_Tool/11294480). For example, I have recently assessed the [predictive power of the Pauling rules](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ange.202000829).

:woman_technologist: For example, I have contributed to [pymatgen](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/), [custodian](https://github.com/materialsproject/custodian/), and [atomate](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/atomate/).

:page_with_curl: You can find a list of my publications [here](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=bggcIYEAAAAJ&hl=en).

:computer: My [website](https://jageo.github.io/) contains more info.

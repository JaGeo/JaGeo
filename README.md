### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:woman_scientist: I am a permanent researcher and junior group leader at the [Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (Bundesanstalt fÃ¼r Materialforschung und -prÃ¼fung)](https://www.bam.de/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html) in Berlin, Germany, and I develop code to do materials science.

:atom_symbol: I am searching for new materials with desired properties for thermoelectric materials, solar cells and batteries. I aim at understanding materials properties with the help of [bonding analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jcc.26353) ([:lobster:](http://www.cohp.de/)) and [coordination environments](https://chemrxiv.org/articles/ChemEnv_A_Fast_and_Robust_Coordination_Environment_Identification_Tool/11294480). For example, I have recently assessed the [predictive power of the Pauling rules](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ange.202000829). We have also developed a code to automatically perform bonding analysis: [LobsterPy :lobster::snake:](https://github.com/JaGeo/LobsterPy).

:woman_technologist: I have contributed to [pymatgen](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen/), [custodian](https://github.com/materialsproject/custodian/), [atomate](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/atomate/), and [atomate2](https://github.com/materialsproject/atomate2/). I have also developed some smaller packages to analyse phonons.

:computer: My [website](https://jageo.github.io/) contains more info. And, you can find me on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@MolecularXtal), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MolecularXtal) and [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/janine-george-5b9027156)
